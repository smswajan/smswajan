# Hey, I'm Swajan 👋

**Co-Founder & CEO @ [fredocloud](https://fredocloud.com) · Senior Full Stack Engineer @ [MyelinZ](https://myelinz.com)**

I went from managing payroll for 700+ employees at British American Tobacco to building software that runs entire businesses. Now I lead a team across 7 countries, shipping AI-powered platforms, custom SaaS products, and automation systems for companies in healthcare, real estate, finance, and government.

### 💡 What I Care About

Building tech that understands how real businesses operate — not tech that fights against it. Every system I've built started with the same question: *how does this team actually work?*

I've sat inside corporate operations. I've seen what breaks when systems don't talk to each other. That perspective shapes everything we build at fredocloud.
